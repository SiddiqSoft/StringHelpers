The latest is always supported. These are all header-files so no binaries to worry about. However, if you are using NuGet, please keep them updated!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The tests are run with AddressSanitizer and GitHub's CodeQL.
If you do find issues, I'd appreciate the kindness of reporting it. The ideal approach is to open an issue here at GitHub.

The turn-around time would be within days of reporting.

Thank you.
